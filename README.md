# Did or Wish

This is my first app using angular 2 and Firebase, I was just playing around and I thought that it would be a cool app to build.

This app is somewhat a replacement for my to-do list. I use this app to track things that I did instead of things to do. Because when I miss things in my to do list I feel like a failure. However, with this idea of logging things I did, things I wish I would have done, and things that I shouldn't do but did, I will be able to have a better reflection on my productivity and planning. I cam across this idea in [The Power of No](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401945872/) by [James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/).
